This project aims to visualize the data that we collected for our media tourism project. We specifically tried to demontrate the relevance
of media tourism and Japanese Anime and whether filmed locations or scenery that was inspired by certain locations within animes
could influence which locations were most popular and if so, how we would show that on our website.

We mainly tried to achieve ~ things:
    First, how are we going to visualize the different data - popularity of location - by year?
    Second, how are we going to mark and show the animes that we think would have been influential to the tourism industry?
    Third, how do we choose our selection of movies such that we would have a better representation of the effect of media tourism?
