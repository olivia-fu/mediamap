In order to enact the interactive map, we had to import mainly folium, a python package that would allow us to create an interactive map straight
away. Most of our data points were of longitudes and latitudes which were collected per province. We were able to collect our data from the Japanese
media tourism site and the rankings of our movies via wikipedia. We researched where each anime was made in order to create markers.

Regarding python extensions, we downloaded mainly folium, panda, and selenium because we wanted to create an interactive map.
(once we click on the marker it could lead to an html page)
(we can do this for 1 or 2 movies instead of all of them - for example we can click the marker)
(we'd also need a thing where we can either select the tourism by year or by movie)
(we can create an html page that connects to the marker afterwards)

In order to collaborate on the same project, we used github repository which allowed for us to work on the same project simulatneously.
